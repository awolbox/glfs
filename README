NOTES
       uses: echo, cat parted, tar, and more.
       (nothing fancy, unfinished, needs more work!)

OPTIONS
	   -c, --config
              If this option is set, then the absolute path to a valid config file must be specified WITHIN PARENTHESIS (ex. ""), Otherwise a fatal error will 
			  occur and the program exits with a return value. If a config file is specified, all variables will be checked and if the config file is conside-
			  red "valid", it will be used. If not the program exits with another fatal error.

	   -h, --help
		      Show help and usage information

	   -v, --version 
			  Show version information

	   -s, --silent
			  Do not promt the user for anything. Automatically installs needed dependencies, also disables all output from STDOUT. In which case, one would have
			  to check the return value -- ex. 'echo $?'. See EXIT STATUS for more info.

	   -i, --info
			  Queries the SRCBUILD file inside of a working directory, then sends various information to STDOUT.

	   -x, --cc
			  Instructs makesrc to cross-compile a new working toolchain. See below.

   Cross-compilation toolchain options

	   --cc-dev DEVICE
			  Cross-compilition device. DEVICE equals the device name to build upon ( using "device labels" - Ex. /dev/sdx ).
	   --cc-dir DIR
			  Cross-compilation directory. DIR is the absolute path to the device mounted on the host system.
	   --cc-wipe 0 R 1
			  Choose to "wipe" disk using zeros "0", random data "R", both, or disable this function completely with "1".
